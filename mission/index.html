        <h2>Why This Mission Matters</h2>
        <p>“For many who have fallen into addiction and ended up on the streets, this is the last stop before they are lost forever. From the streets, there are often only a few paths left – to remain trapped in the cycle of homelessness, to lose their lives to it, or to find a way back home.</p>
        <p>We want to be that way back home. We want to be the difference between a family losing a loved one forever and welcoming them back into their lives. Every act of compassion, every meal shared, every prayer offered could be the turning point that saves a life.</p>
        <p>This mission is urgent because each day on the streets is a day closer to losing someone forever. For every person who finds their way back, there’s a family who gets their loved one back. This is about life, death, and the hope of redemption.”</p>

        <h2>What Salvation Through Jesus Means</h2>
        <p>“Salvation Through Jesus is the divine act of being rescued, restored, and renewed by the love and power of Jesus Christ. No matter how lost or broken someone feels, there is always a way back – through Him.</p>
        <p>Salvation doesn’t come by our strength or through good deeds; it flows through Jesus – through His grace, His sacrifice, and His living presence in our hearts.</p>
        <p>To live Salvation Through Jesus is to let that same saving love flow through us into the lives of others. It’s the moment when a meal becomes mercy, a prayer becomes hope, and a simple act of kindness becomes an act of divine compassion.</p>
        <p>This ministry is about being vessels of His love – carrying light into dark places and reminding people that they are seen, loved, and not forgotten by God. It is rescue in every sense – spiritual, emotional, and physical – moving through the hands and hearts of those who serve in His name.”</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>“At Salvation Through Jesus, we believe every person on the streets is someone’s son, daughter, brother, or friend. They are not forgotten by God, and they are not forgotten by us.</p>
        <p>Our Purpose – We are called to help those who have lost connection to their families and support systems because of addiction or hardship. Our mission is to reach out and help them take that first step back – to reconnect them with the people who love them and remind them they are still cherished.</p>
        <p>What We Do – Through simple acts of kindness – sharing a meal, offering a prayer, and providing a moment of hope – we aim to start a spark that leads to a family phone call, a reunion, a bridge back home. Every act of love can be the turning point for someone to find their way back to life, family, and faith.</p>
        <p>Our Vision – In the light of Jesus, we see a path for every lost soul to come home. This is our calling. This is the heart of Salvation Through Jesus.”</p>
